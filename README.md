	<i>Listen, your life could depend on this. Don’t even blink. Blink and you’re dead. They are fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away and don’t blink. Good luck.</i>

**Two teams**, the Survivors and Angels.  
**Two phases**, Lockdown and Extermination.  

The Angels are moving statues that cannot move or be harmed when observed. When unobserved, they can move at incredible speeds, and kill their prey with ease.
The Survivors are the poor victims who were caught in the lockdown. They must survive until backup arrives. With good team work and strategizing, the Survivors can use the weapons available in their environment to kill the Angels.  

Once backup has arrived, the Angels must try their best at escaping through the entrance the backup made while the Survivors must eradicate them.
The Survivors are equipped with a weapon designed with the sole purpose of exterminating Angels.
If even a single Angel escapes, it's the Survivors' loss.
